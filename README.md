### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I made sure my code is reliable and efficient by following the 'Three C's of Software Quality: Competency, Completeness, and Correctness.

I used Functional Testing to check that each part of the software works as required. This involves testing each feature with specific inputs and looking for expected outputs. I then compare the actual outputs to what I expected. 

I also performed Unit Testing, which tests the smallest parts of the code. This let me verify that each piece works correctly by running them alone. This approach is important for quality because it tests each unit separately, ensuring that the software is reliable.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Consulting with the customer or client to recieve the requirments of the program and understand the problem/goal. Researching if the idea is realistic, functional, and can be implemented. Creating a UML diagram, reviewing the requirements are met. Create testing envoirnment and identify the priorities. Start the development process. Write unit tests for functions, classes, and ensure data is recieving the expected outputs.

### How do I approach designing software?
I utilize testing techniques to create test cases that evaluate the functionality of individual components within each class, ensuring they behave as expected. I design UI diagrams using Figma to reference when implementing the front end of the code. I adhere to best coding practices when writing functions, verifying that the correct parameters are present and that the required data is returned.
